# But how to hack the scientist brain ??

We can start from a relatively easy question - how to convince more scientists to join the Brainhack Global next year. If you have any suggestions (not necessarily rational, we take all!) please add them to the file. Please share success or failure story convincing your friends and colleagues to a Brainhack.

And add new mardown files for any other issue you have with co-scientist that are worth hacking!
